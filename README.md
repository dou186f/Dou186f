# üëã Hi, I'm Doƒüu Erba≈ü

üéì I'm a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Middle East Technical University (METU).  
üí° I‚Äôm interested in **software development**, **algorithms**, and **digital systems** ‚Äî approaching each project with both technical precision and curiosity.

### üß† About Me

I enjoy building software that connects technology with real-world needs.
Recently, I worked as a Software Intern at Europower Energy, where I developed two full-stack applications from scratch using C#, .NET MAUI, ASP.NET Core, ADO.NET, and SQL Server.
Through this experience, I gained a solid foundation in API development, database design, and the .NET ecosystem, while contributing to the digitalization of industrial production and quality control processes.
I'm currently expanding my skills toward machine learning, deep learning, and game development, aiming to explore how intelligent systems and interactive technologies can create meaningful experiences.
